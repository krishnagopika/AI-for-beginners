    "# Data Cleaning/Preperation for LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a Large Language Model (LLM) requires massive amounts of high-quality, diverse, and well-structured text data. However, raw data from the web, documents, chat logs, or repositories is often noisy, inconsistent, and redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without proper cleaning and preprocessing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model may learn incorrect patterns or biases.\n",
    "- Training can be inefficient and resource-heavy.\n",
    "- Model performance on real-world tasks may be poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Challenges in Data Cleaning for LLMs**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Volume\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLMs are trained on billions of tokens—manual cleaning is impractical.\n",
    "- Requires automated yet intelligent cleaning workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data may come from multiple domains, formats, and languages.\n",
    "- Requires normalization to maintain coherence and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Noise and Irrelevant Content\n",
    "\n",
    "- Raw text includes typos, HTML tags, boilerplate code, spam, etc.\n",
    "- Models trained on noisy data may produce unreliable or harmful outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bias and Toxicity\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unfiltered data can contain societal, cultural, or political biases.\n",
    "- Requires specialized filtering techniques to promote fairness and safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Redundancy and Duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "- Duplicate content can lead to overfitting and wasted computation.\n",
    "- De-duplication is crucial for scalable and diverse learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Privacy and Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Must avoid including Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\n",
    "- Legal constraints like GDPR make ethical data handling critical.\n",
