# Prompt Engineering


### Prompt and Completion

A prompt is the input text you provide to a model, and the completion is the model's output. The goal of prompt engineering is to design prompts that guide the model to produce the desired output.


#### Prompt Structure

```
`system message`: [System-level instructions to set context or behavior for the model]
`context`: [Optional; provides additional relevant background or constraints for more accurate responses]
`user input`: [The user's query or task; what the model is supposed to respond to]
`output_format`: [Optional; specifies the desired format of the output, such as list, paragraph, or specific style]
```

**Using Delimiters**

- Use clear delimiters to break down different parts of the prompt. These help ensure that each section is clearly understood by the model.
- Code block delimiter (```), triple quotes ("""), angle brackets (<>) or tags (<tag></tag>) can be used for different sections.

**Parameters**

- **n (number of choices)**: Specifies how many distinct response options the model should generate.
Example: n=3 generates 3 outputs.

- **max_tokens**: Limits the number of tokens the model can use in its response.
Example: max_tokens=150 restricts the output to 150 tokens.

- **stop**: Defines the stopping point for text generation.
Example: "stop": ["\n"] stops at a newline.

- **temperature**: Controls the randomness of the model’s responses.
Example: temperature=0.7 allows for creative responses.

- **top_p**: Uses nucleus sampling, considering tokens with cumulative probability greater than top_p.

- **top_k**: Limits the number of candidate tokens the model considers for the next word.


### Prompt Engineering Techniques

#### zero-shot and few-shot

**Zero-shot**: Model generates responses without prior examples.

**Few-shot**: Provides a few examples to guide the model’s responses.

#### chain of thought

A structured approach where the model is prompted to break down the reasoning process step-by-step.

#### ReAct

Combines reasoning and actions where the model alternates between logical reasoning and taking actions like querying external data.

#### usecase

Sentiment Analysis, Keyword Extraction and Summarization of product reviews

```

```

#### hallucinations

- LLM generating factually incorrect or nonsensical information.
- misalignmnet of text generation objectve and user's objective of desired responses.

**NLP hallucination types:**

- intrinsic: input info is manupulated
- extrinsic: info not in input is added

**Sources of hallucinations**
- Imprefect representation learning
- Erroneous decoding
- Exposure bias
- parametric knowledge bias

**LLM Hallucinations Types:**

1. Factuality Hallucination
    - Factual Inconsistency
    - Factual Fabrication
2. Faithfulness Hallucination
   - Instruction Inconsistency
   - Context Inconsistency
   - logical Inconsistency


#### security considerations

- PII (Personally Identifiable Information): Sensitive data, such as names, addresses, or contact details, that can be used to identify individuals.

- Data Privacy: Ensuring that user data used in LLM interactions is not stored or exposed inappropriately.

- Jailbreaking: Bypassing or disabling the model's built-in safeguards to generate unintended or harmful outputs.

- Prompt Injection: Manipulating the input prompt to trick the model into producing unwanted or harmful responses.

- Bias and Fairness: Safeguarding against biased responses or content that may perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

- Content Moderation: Implementing checks to prevent harmful, illegal, or unethical content generation.
